		Walter Gordon is a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Public Energy Humanities at TECS. His research is concerned with African American literature, energy, and the environment, particularly in relation to questions of labor. He is currently working on two projects: a digital, interactive adaptation of Shirley Graham’s 1941 play Dust to Earth, and a monograph entitled “Oh, Awful Power”: Energy and Modernity in African American Literature, which tracks the interlinked cultural histories of King Coal and Jim Crow.
